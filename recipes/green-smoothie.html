<p>Now you might be wondering why you'll need a green smoothie for survival. It's actually to counter the effects of the popchicken goodness you absorbed so that you can inhale more popcorn chicken later without too much detriment to your heatlh.</p>
<p>You'll need some kind of blender for this recipe. If you don't have a Vitamix, then one of the beverage bullets will do; otherwise, I don't know how else you'd be able to breakdown all the produce and greens into liquid bits. Here's the simple recipe for a healthy and, more importantly, tasty green smoothie.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>banana</li>
        <li>apple</li>
        <li>orange</li>
        <li>two handfuls of kale</li>
        <li>two handfuls of spinach</li>
        <li>a handful of ice cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of your favorite plant-based milk, or you can use dairy milk if you'd like</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the banana and orange, and core out the apple.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk in, then the ice, then the fruit and veggies.</li>
        <li>Start the blender on low then slowly increase the speed and blend for about a minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the blended goodness into your favorite glass, cup, or vessel. Sip, gulp, or what have you, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you can go back to fueling up on popcorn chicken <em>without</em> guilt.</p>
