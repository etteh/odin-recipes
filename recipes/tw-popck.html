        <p>Popcorn chicken's name is funny. It's not exactly popcorn. Popcorn is the result of heated corn kernels. Is popcorn chicken a result of heated chicken? It kind of is.</p>
        <p>But you should not expect it to be ready made within two minutes in a microwave. Here's a simple recipe that explains step-by-step how to make popcorn chicken just like the kind found in Taichung's Fenchia Night Market.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <h4>For the Chicken and Marinade:</h4>
            <li>1.5 pounds of chicken breasts or thighs</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of shaoxing wine or orange juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of 5-spice powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of white pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
            <h4>For the Batter:</h4>
            <li>1/4 cup of all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>2 tbsps of sweet potato starch</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of white pepper</li>
            <h4>Finishing add:</h4>
            <li>a handful of Thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>enough vegetable or canola oil to submerge the chicken</li>
            <li>additional salt and pepper if you want your life more salty and peppery</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice up the chicken into small one-inch cubes. They could be bigger cubes if you'd like, but the chicken will probably just need to fry a little longer. What's the saying? "Good things come to those who wait."? Go big or go home then.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic as much as you can, which the outcome will likely be better than what I can do, according to my wife.</li>
            <li>Mix the garlic, soy sauce, shaoxing wine (or orange juice), sugar, 5-spice powder (why is this in many Chinese/Taiwanese dishes?), white pepper, and salt.</li>
            <li>Put on your favorite pair of food-preparation gloves (or just make sure your hands are thoroughly washed, ya nasty) and massage the previously mixed ingredients in with the diced up chicken. Let the two get to know one another for a while, like 20 minutes, before getting married in batter.</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients for the batter well, and coat each piece of diced chicken with the batter. You can attempt to toss the two together like a saute in a sizeable bowl if you're feeling adventurous, or if you're like conservative lil ol'me, then juse use a pair of chopsticks to coat every one. The chopsticks will keep your hands clean of the batter, too. Let these get to know one another for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat up a pot of canola/vegetable oil up to 350 degrees, then begin frying small batches of chicken. I like to let the fried chicken rest on a baking wire rack over some paper towels just so it can cool off and drip excess oil, but you do you do you do you.</li>
            <li>Lastly--and this is the loud and potentially traumatizing part--fry the thai basil leaves. Drop the leaves in the pot and quickly cover the pot with a lid to prevent burns. Sprinkle those freshly fried Thai basil goodness over the chicken. Here's where you can make your life more salty and peppery, too.</li>
